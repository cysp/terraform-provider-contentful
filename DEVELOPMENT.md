# Development

This project uses Go-native tooling entrypoints for development workflows.

## Repository guidance

[AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) is the authoritative repository guidance;
[CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) and [GEMINI.md](GEMINI.md) import it. Keep shared rules
there and command details here. Design contracts belong in `docs/design/`;
link them from the instructions with the conditions that require reading them.

## Validation scope

Select checks by the changed behavior, using the commands below. When preparing
a code change for merge, inspect the remote checks for that revision;
[`.github/workflows/`](.github/workflows/) defines the current CI matrix.
The matrix does not require replaying every CI job locally. Live acceptance
tests require authorization to use the real Contentful account; available
credentials alone do not establish that authorization.

| Change | Local verification |
| --- | --- |
| Agent instructions or prose only | Review instruction consistency, links, and the final diff; run `git diff --check`. |
| Go behavior | Run tests for the affected packages and the lint and format checks. Use `go test ./...` and `go build .` for shared behavior or when preparing for merge. |
| Terraform planning, state, or lifecycle | Run focused mocked acceptance tests for the affected transitions in addition to the Go checks; extend coverage where existing tests do not establish the changed behavior. |
| Schema, examples, OpenAPI, or other generation inputs | Follow the [generation requirement](AGENTS.md#documentation-and-workflow) using [Code Generation](#code-generation), plus checks for the affected behavior. |
| A claim about live Contentful behavior | Use primary documentation or an authorized live experiment; mocked tests establish provider behavior against the fixture, not CMA conformance. |

If a check cannot run, record the command and concrete blocker. Distinguish a
passing check from a skipped test or an environment failure. Local verification
does not establish that remote CI passed.

## Code Generation

The commands below implement the
[generation requirement](AGENTS.md#documentation-and-workflow).

Running the root generator requires Terraform on `PATH` because it formats
Terraform examples before regenerating provider documentation. The narrower
management API client generator does not require Terraform.

Full generation command, run from the repository root:

```sh
go generate ./...
```

The full generation command runs the package-local `go:generate` directives:

- `go generate .` formats Terraform examples under `examples/` and regenerates
  provider documentation with `tfplugindocs`.
- `go generate ./internal/contentful-management-go` regenerates the Contentful
  Management API client from
  `internal/contentful-management-go/openapi/openapi.yml` using
  `internal/contentful-management-go/ogen.yml`.

For faster iteration on one generated surface:

```sh
go generate .
go generate ./internal/contentful-management-go
```

Generated files include `internal/contentful-management-go/oas_*_gen.go` and
the generated schema sections in `docs/`. Edit their sources: the provider
schema, examples, templates, or OpenAPI input.

To check reproducibility, rerun the generators in a clean checkout containing
the intended input and generated changes. Use a separate checkout if the working
directory contains unrelated changes. The same cleanliness check as CI prints
short status, including untracked output, before failing when generation causes
drift:

```sh
generated_status="$(git status --short --untracked-files=all)"
if [ -n "$generated_status" ]; then
  printf '%s\n' "$generated_status"
  exit 1
fi
```

## Tests

With `TF_ACC` unset, run the normal unit and local integration test suite:

```sh
go test ./...
```

Run a focused package or test while iterating:

```sh
go test ./internal/provider -run TestContentTypeModelRoundTrip -count=1
```

Run mocked Terraform acceptance tests locally:

```sh
TF_ACC=1 TF_ACC_MOCKED=1 go test ./internal/provider -run '^TestAcc' -count=1
```

For authorized live Terraform acceptance tests, configure
`CONTENTFUL_MANAGEMENT_ACCESS_TOKEN` in the environment. Clear `TF_ACC_MOCKED`
for the command so an inherited mock setting cannot mask a live check:

```sh
env -u TF_ACC_MOCKED TF_ACC=1 go test ./internal/provider -run '^TestAcc' -count=1
```

Acceptance tests require a Terraform CLI on `PATH`. Mocked acceptance tests use
local HTTP test servers; they do not call Contentful, but they still exercise
the Terraform acceptance-test harness.

## Linting

Install the [official golangci-lint binary](https://golangci-lint.run/docs/welcome/install/local/#binaries)
at the version recorded in [`.golangci-lint-version`](.golangci-lint-version),
then run the repository checks:

```sh
golangci-lint run
golangci-lint fmt --diff
```
